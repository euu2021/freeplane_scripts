## Tags

Scripts can belong to more than one category, so they are tagged. Ctrl-F a tag to find everything in that category.

- `navigation` — move the selection / jump around the map
- `selection` — select nodes
- `tags` — work with node tags
- `styles` — styles, colors, edges, themes
- `filter/search` — filtering and live search
- `panel/GUI` — floating panels, dialogs, sliders
- `maps` — multiple maps, view-roots, links between maps
- `editing` — create, duplicate or modify nodes
- `fold/minimize` — folding and minimizing nodes
- `clipboard` — clipboard operations
- `listener` — runs continuously, reacting to events
- `init` — runs once at startup
- `view` — zoom, layout, viewport
- `connectors` — works with connectors
- `experimental` — prototype / proof of concept

## Scripts

Sibling scripts (directional variants, script pairs) share a single row.

| [initScriptsTool](scripts/initScriptsTool.groovy) · [Bridge](scripts/initScriptsToolBridge.groovy) | Runs every `//init` script found across your script folders and reports which ran; the *Bridge* is a small file you drop in your profile's `scripts/init/` folder so the tool runs at startup. | `init` |
| [invertMapColors](scripts/invertMapColors.groovy) | Toggles the whole map between light and dark themes (styles + background). | `styles` |

| [justifyTopicAlignment](scripts/justifyTopicAlignment.groovy) | Aligns each level automatically, XMind-style. | `view` `listener` |
| [leftRightTraversal](scripts/leftRightTraversal.groovy) | Tweaks Left/Right arrow-key behavior when traversing nodes. | `navigation` `selection` |
| [LiveFilterPanel](scripts/LiveFilterPanel.groovy) | Search panel that, on every keystroke, hides everything except the matches and their ancestor path (live filter over the whole map). | `filter/search` `panel/GUI` |
| navigationLimitedToSiblings [Down](scripts/navigationLimitedToSiblingsDown.groovy) · [UP](scripts/navigationLimitedToSiblingsUP.groovy) | Moves the selection up/down, but only among siblings (won't leave the level). | `navigation` `selection` |

| [openLinkedMapAndClose](scripts/openLinkedMapAndClose.groovy) | Opens the map linked from the selected node and closes the current one (backlink navigation without piling up open maps). | `maps` `navigation` |
| [OutlineLiveFilter](scripts/OutlineLiveFilter.groovy) | Type-to-filter field docked in the Outline panel; filters the outline only, leaving the map untouched. | `filter/search` `panel/GUI` |

| select [DOWN](scripts/selectDOWN.groovy) · [UP](scripts/selectUP.groovy) · [LEFT](scripts/selectLEFT.groovy) · [RIGHT](scripts/selectRIGHT.groovy) | Free-selects the node in the given direction and re-centers the view. | `navigation` `selection` |

| [selectNodesByCloud](scripts/selectNodesByCloud.groovy) | Selects nodes by clicking on the clouds drawn around them. | `selection` |
| selectionLimitedToSiblings [Down](scripts/selectionLimitedToSiblingsDown.groovy) · [Up](scripts/selectionLimitedToSiblingsUp.groovy) | Extends the selection up/down, but only among siblings. | `selection` `navigation` |
| [setCreationDateToChildren](scripts/setCreationDateToChildren.groovy) | Sets a creation date on the selected nodes' children via a dialog. | `editing` |

| [TagCategoryDialogFilter](scripts/TagCategoryDialogFilter.groovy) | Docks a live filter field in the "Manage tag categories" dialog; each keystroke filters the tag tree and auto-expands it, so matches inside collapsed branches show up. | `tags` `filter/search` `panel/GUI` |
| [TagFilterAutoExpand](scripts/TagFilterAutoExpand.groovy) | Makes the Tag panel's native filter auto-expand, so matching tags inside collapsed branches become visible (they stay hidden otherwise). Works as a menu or startup (init) script. | `tags` `filter/search` `init` |

| [UtilityPanels](https://github.com/euu2021/Freeplane_UtilityPanels) ↗ | Collection of utility panels built into Freeplane's UI: quick search (with lines to results), recent nodes, breadcrumbs, in-place siblings preview, inspector tooltips, and more. Hosted in its own repository. | `panel/GUI` `filter/search` `navigation` |
| [zoomTo100](scripts/zoomTo100.groovy) | Sets the map zoom to 100%. | `view` |
